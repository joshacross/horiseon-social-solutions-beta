<h2>Description</h2>
<p>
    The following website is an on-the-job ticket that required me, as a developer, to refract existing code by modifying and consolidating the existing HTML and CSS language and structure, allowing for a more SEO-friendly and accessible website.
</p>
<p>
    Providing web accessibility is extremely important for businesses. Not only does it assist people with disabilities accessing a companies website, it allows for favorable and optimized positioning on search engines such as Google, Bing, and Yahoo.
<p>
    To increase long-term sustainability, accessilibity, and Search Engine Optimization:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        Updated the HTML semantic language by replacing division elements <code>&#60div&#62</code> with HTML5 elements <code>&#60header&#62</code> <code>&#60footer&#62</code> <code>&#60section&#62</code> and <code>&#60article&#62</code>
    </li>
    <li>
        Insured all links are properly formatted
    </li>
    <li>
        Properly restructured and formatted the CSS stylesheet
    </li>
    <li>
        Consolidated duplicated CSS code by using article classes
    </li>
</ul>
